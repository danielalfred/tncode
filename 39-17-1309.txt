            Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a public institution of higher education shall be absolutely immune from claims for monetary damages arising solely from or related to an employee's use of, or failure to use, a handgun; provided the employee is employed by the institution against whom the claim is filed and the employee elects to carry the handgun pursuant to this subdivision (e)(11). Nothing in this section shall expand the existing conditions under which sovereign immunity is waived pursuant to § 9-8-307; and
            As used in subdivisions (e)(11)-(13):
